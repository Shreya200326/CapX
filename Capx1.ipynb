Their research on rheumatoid arthritis treatment got me intrigued because it's not every day you hear about potential game-changers in the medical field.\\n\\nWould love to hear some insights from people who’ve been following them for a while.\\n\\nCEL-SCI looks like it's onto something big with their LEAPS technology, especially in treating rheumatoid arthritis. Unlike traditional meds that suppress the immune system, their approach with CEL-4000 aims to rebalance it, targeting RA without compromising our body's defenses against other threats like infections or cancer. It reshapes how we fight autoimmune diseases altogether.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Main Bits:**\\n\\n* Current RA treatments mainly involve suppressing the immune system, which can have drawbacks like leaving patients vulnerable to infections and cancer.\\n* CEL-SCI's LEAPS technology, particularly CEL-4000, offers a fresh approach by rebalancing the immune system to target RA specifically while preserving its ability to fight off other threats.\\n* The article suggests using adaptive study designs and disease-related biomarkers in clinical trials, potentially revolutionizing how we approach treatment in autoimmune diseases.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**TLDR:** CEl-SCI’s new tech seems exciting, would love to get your thoughts on it.\",\n",

Wish I could add a picture of it! 😭 \\n\\n\\\\---\\n\\nMIAMI--([BUSINESS WIRE](https://www.businesswire.com/))--ShiftPixy, Inc. (Nasdaq: PIXY) (“ShiftPixy” or “the Company”), a Florida-based national staffing enterprise which designs, manages, and sells access to a disruptive, revolutionary platform that facilitates employment in the rapidly growing Gig Economy, today released a video further detailing its new “Fast Fill” recruiting technology first announced December 13, 2022. As reported at the time, many of the multi-unit fast food operators that endured the pandemic are now seeing activity pick up, but finding themselves unable to fill open positions, often due to weaker than ever “bench strength”. Fast Fill, which ShiftPixy is launching with a “Need Workers?” marketing campaign aimed at restaurant operators, is designed to directly reach available workers through mobile technology, encouraging immediate sign up for available QSR (quick service restaurant) shifts.\\n\\nSmartphones have become a necessity of daily life, and have dramatically altered how people access information. Studies show that 94% of consumers look for local information on their smartphones, and 90% of those audiences take action as a result. The widespread use of smartphones to search the internet, shop, be entertained, and find local information provides marketers with the ability to target an audience that is constantly connected.\\n\\nShiftPixy’s extensive analytics enable its fast fill algorithm to precisely identify and target potential shift workers for population. Once a potential shift worker is identified, the fast fill algorithm connects with them to present shift work opportunities and immediately move them through a high touch digital process to put them to work on the opportunities they select.\\n\\n“Keeping the bench full with qualified workers remains a challenge for today’s QSR operators, and our Fast Fill mobile technology allows them to reach the workers of today quickly and efficiently where they live and socialize,” said ShiftPixy Co-Founder and CEO, Scott Absher. “As discussed in the accompanying video, our most recent tests with our fast food clients needing to fill as many as 100 openings has exceeded expectations, turning what once was a six-month endeavor into perhaps a two-week success story. We’re capturing the attention of interested shift workers, motivating them to work and by so doing, accelerating the growth of our QSR clients.”\\n\\n**About ShiftPixy**   \\nShiftPixy is a disruptive human capital services enterprise, revolutionizing employment in the Gig Economy by delivering a next-gen platform for workforce management that helps businesses with shift-based employees navigate regulatory mandates, minimize administrative burdens and better connect with a ready-for-hire workforce. With expertise rooted in management’s more than 25 years of workers’ compensation and compliance programs experience, ShiftPixy adds a needed layer for addressing compliance and continued demands for equitable employment practices in the growing Gig Economy.\\n\\n**Forward-Looking Statements**   \\nAny statements contained in this press release that do not describe historical facts may constitute forward-looking statements.

Def need a little chill weekend but before the day ends just thought I’d fire out a little post as I’m curious to hear some takes on small cap mining, specifically Uranium. \\n\\nI’ve always been a mining guy myself, and one of the biggest challenges when talking to companies and investors is that everyone claims they have big shiny rocks in the ground. Or that their deposit is beside some mine that pumped out 2+ million ounces last year or whatever. It's really hard to narrow it down to who is actually profitable. \\n\\nOne sector I’ve been checking out recently is the uranium sector. I’ve overheard a couple of brokers I work with that they are interested in looking into some uranium deals due to the big global demand for it recently. It got me curious to do some research and digging on it myself which resulted in me coming across Myriad Uranium (M.CN). \\n\\nWhat caught my attention is that they actually operate out of Niger Africa, which isn’t really a massive country for uranium exploration currently but that is going to change soon. The proof behind that is that a lot of new players want to enter the scene there based on recent news of high grade uranium samples being discovered by Orano. However, Myriad has that first movers advantage everyone wants to know about. Myriad has licenses running through the Tim Mersoï Basin which is Africa’s largest uranium deposit according to various sources. On top of that Myriads Geophysics program will be beginning later this summer and into the fall which has their community pretty amped up. \\n\\nI know I mentioned early that so many mining companies say stuff like this but Myriad operates in a very unique area. There are not a ton of players in their area yet which is why they stand out to me a little more than others. Would love for any of you to take a look into them with me, and happy to get some discussion going here! Let me know what you guys think! \",\n",

(Nasdaq: PIXY) (“ShiftPixy” or “the Company”), a Florida-based national staffing enterprise which designs, manages, and sells access to a disruptive, revolutionary platform that facilitates employment in the rapidly growing Gig Economy, today released a video further detailing its new “Fast Fill” recruiting technology first announced December 13, 2022. As reported at the time, many of the multi-unit fast food operators that endured the pandemic are now seeing activity pick up, but finding themselves unable to fill open positions, often due to weaker than ever “bench strength”. Fast Fill, which ShiftPixy is launching with a “Need Workers?” marketing campaign aimed at restaurant operators, is designed to directly reach available workers through mobile technology, encouraging immediate sign up for available QSR (quick service restaurant) shifts.\\n\\nSmartphones have become a necessity of daily life, and have dramatically altered how people access information. Studies show that 94% of consumers look for local information on their smartphones, and 90% of those audiences take action as a result. The widespread use of smartphones to search the internet, shop, be entertained, and find local information provides marketers with the ability to target an audience that is constantly connected.\\n\\nShiftPixy’s extensive analytics enable its fast fill algorithm to precisely identify and target potential shift workers for population. Once a potential shift worker is identified, the fast fill algorithm connects with them to present shift work opportunities and immediately move them through a high touch digital process to put them to work on the opportunities they select.\\n\\n“Keeping the bench full with qualified workers remains a challenge for today’s QSR operators, and our Fast Fill mobile technology allows them to reach the workers of today quickly and efficiently where they live and socialize,” said ShiftPixy Co-Founder and CEO, Scott Absher. “As discussed in the accompanying video, our most recent tests with our fast food clients needing to fill as many as 100 openings has exceeded expectations, turning what once was a six-month endeavor into perhaps a two-week success story. We’re capturing the attention of interested shift workers, motivating them to work and by so doing, accelerating the growth of our QSR clients.”\\n\\n**About ShiftPixy**   \\nShiftPixy is a disruptive human capital services enterprise, revolutionizing employment in the Gig Economy by delivering a next-gen platform for workforce management that helps businesses with shift-based employees navigate regulatory mandates, minimize administrative burdens and better connect with a ready-for-hire workforce. With expertise rooted in management’s more than 25 years of workers’ compensation and compliance programs experience, ShiftPixy adds a needed layer for addressing compliance and continued demands for equitable employment practices in the growing Gig Economy.\\n\\n**Forward-Looking Statements**   \\nAny statements contained in this press release that do not describe historical facts may constitute forward-looking statements.

Or that their deposit is beside some mine that pumped out 2+ million ounces last year or whatever. It's really hard to narrow it down to who is actually profitable. \\n\\nOne sector I’ve been checking out recently is the uranium sector. I’ve overheard a couple of brokers I work with that they are interested in looking into some uranium deals due to the big global demand for it recently.

The proof behind that is that a lot of new players want to enter the scene there based on recent news of high grade uranium samples being discovered by Orano. However, Myriad has that first movers advantage everyone wants to know about. Myriad has licenses running through the Tim Mersoï Basin which is Africa’s largest uranium deposit according to various sources.

Wish I could add a picture of it! 😭 \\n\\n\\\\---\\n\\nMIAMI--([BUSINESS WIRE](https://www.businesswire.com/))--ShiftPixy, Inc. (Nasdaq: PIXY) (“ShiftPixy” or “the Company”), a Florida-based national staffing enterprise which designs, manages, and sells access to a disruptive, revolutionary platform that facilitates employment in the rapidly growing Gig Economy, today released a video further detailing its new “Fast Fill” recruiting technology first announced December 13, 2022. As reported at the time, many of the multi-unit fast food operators that endured the pandemic are now seeing activity pick up, but finding themselves unable to fill open positions, often due to weaker than ever “bench strength”. Fast Fill, which ShiftPixy is launching with a “Need Workers?” marketing campaign aimed at restaurant operators, is designed to directly reach available workers through mobile technology, encouraging immediate sign up for available QSR (quick service restaurant) shifts.\\n\\nSmartphones have become a necessity of daily life, and have dramatically altered how people access information. Studies show that 94% of consumers look for local information on their smartphones, and 90% of those audiences take action as a result. The widespread use of smartphones to search the internet, shop, be entertained, and find local information provides marketers with the ability to target an audience that is constantly connected.\\n\\nShiftPixy’s extensive analytics enable its fast fill algorithm to precisely identify and target potential shift workers for population. Once a potential shift worker is identified, the fast fill algorithm connects with them to present shift work opportunities and immediately move them through a high touch digital process to put them to work on the opportunities they select.\\n\\n“Keeping the bench full with qualified workers remains a challenge for today’s QSR operators, and our Fast Fill mobile technology allows them to reach the workers of today quickly and efficiently where they live and socialize,” said ShiftPixy Co-Founder and CEO, Scott Absher. “As discussed in the accompanying video, our most recent tests with our fast food clients needing to fill as many as 100 openings has exceeded expectations, turning what once was a six-month endeavor into perhaps a two-week success story. We’re capturing the attention of interested shift workers, motivating them to work and by so doing, accelerating the growth of our QSR clients.”\\n\\n**About ShiftPixy**   \\nShiftPixy is a disruptive human capital services enterprise, revolutionizing employment in the Gig Economy by delivering a next-gen platform for workforce management that helps businesses with shift-based employees navigate regulatory mandates, minimize administrative burdens and better connect with a ready-for-hire workforce. With expertise rooted in management’s more than 25 years of workers’ compensation and compliance programs experience, ShiftPixy adds a needed layer for addressing compliance and continued demands for equitable employment practices in the growing Gig Economy.\\n\\n**Forward-Looking Statements**   \\nAny statements contained in this press release that do not describe historical facts may constitute forward-looking statements.

Or that their deposit is beside some mine that pumped out 2+ million ounces last year or whatever. It's really hard to narrow it down to who is actually profitable. \\n\\nOne sector I’ve been checking out recently is the uranium sector. I’ve overheard a couple of brokers I work with that they are interested in looking into some uranium deals due to the big global demand for it recently. It got me curious to do some research and digging on it myself which resulted in me coming across Myriad Uranium (M.CN). \\n\\nWhat caught my attention is that they actually operate out of Niger Africa, which isn’t really a massive country for uranium exploration currently but that is going to change soon. The proof behind that is that a lot of new players want to enter the scene there based on recent news of high grade uranium samples being discovered by Orano. However, Myriad has that first movers advantage everyone wants to know about. Myriad has licenses running through the Tim Mersoï Basin which is Africa’s largest uranium deposit according to various sources. On top of that Myriads Geophysics program will be beginning later this summer and into the fall which has their community pretty amped up. \\n\\nI know I mentioned early that so many mining companies say stuff like this but Myriad operates in a very unique area. There are not a ton of players in their area yet which is why they stand out to me a little more than others.

The second step employs GeoVax's vector platform using an MVA viral vector to amplify the response.\\n* **CEO David Dodd's Insights:** Dodd emphasizes their current focus on a next-gen COVID-19 vaccine in Phase 2 trials and a cancer immunotherapy program, with Gedeptin® leading the charge in Phase 1/2 clinical trials. While HIV research isn't the primary focus at the moment, it remains a crucial part of their broader development strategy.\\n* **Promising HIV Study Results:** GeoVax's MVA-vectored HIV vaccine played a key role in an experimental combinational HIV therapy study. The trial's goal was a functional cure for HIV-positive individuals. The treatment demonstrated exceptional immunogenicity, especially in T cell immunity, even in compromised immune systems due to HIV infection.\\n\\n**TLDR:**\\n\\nGeoVax Labs, Inc. scores a big win with a patent for their cutting-edge HIV vaccine approach. The method involves a two-step vaccination process, setting a new standard in HIV prevention. CEO David Dodd highlights their ongoing focus on COVID-19 and cancer immunotherapy, while acknowledging the pivotal role of the HIV program in their overall development strategy.
